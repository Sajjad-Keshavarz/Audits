Auction Tokens can be permanently locked in AuctionFactory.â€‹

## Summary

Tokens returned to the `AuctionFactory` after an auction ends cannot be withdrawn, as there is no mechanism in place for doing so. This results in the tokens being permanently locked in the `AuctionFactory` contract.

## Vulnerability Details

In the `FjordAuction::auctionEnd` function, if an auction ends without any bids, all auction tokens are refunded to the owner, which is the `AuctionFactory` contract. However, the `AuctionFactory` contract lacks any function to withdraw these tokens, causing them to be permanently stuck within the contract.

## Code Snippets

## Impact

Tokens may be permanently locked in the `AuctionFactory` contract, making them inaccessible and unusable.

## Tools Used

Manual code review

## Recommendations

Implement an `onlyOwner` function in the `AuctionFactory` contract that allows the withdrawal of tokens stored within it. This function will prevent tokens from being permanently locked.
